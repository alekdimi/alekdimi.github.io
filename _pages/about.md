I'm a machine learning engineer at Google, working on [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) finetuning and inference for teams across [Alphabet](https://abc.xyz). I've been fortunate to work on a wide range of problems, ranging from multimodal capabilities augmentation, to non-generative tasks like text embedding, to automating model hyperparameters and sharding to improve training and inference efficiency.

Before Google, I did my PhD in machine learning at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](http://mingyuanzhou.github.io/), where my research was focused on [Gradient estimation for discrete variables via dependent Monte Carlo samples](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/b2924809-2671-48ba-b004-5e509f50bcc0). I also hold an M.Sc. and B.Sc. in computer science from the [University of Ljubljana](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en).

<!-- I'm a machine learning engineer at [Google](https://about.google/), working on large language models. Before that, I did my PhD in machine learning at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](http://mingyuanzhou.github.io/), where I did research in backpropagating through discrete variables in deep learning. I also hold an M.Sc. and B.Sc. in computer science from the [University of Ljubljana](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en). 
Before starting my PhD, I worked on applying machine learning to different domains. 
I was a visiting researcher at Stanford University, working with [Prof. Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) 
on applying NLP to extract protein-protein interactions from the scientific literature.
 I also worked as a data scientist at [Zemanta](https://www.zemanta.com/) 
 and [Salviol](http://www.salviol.com/) preventing fraud in native advertising and insurance claims, 
 respectively. For more details, see my [resume](assets/pdf/Resume-Alek-Dimitriev.pdf).  
 In my free time, i like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9349542-alek), 
 listen to podcasts, and think about how best to [improve the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). -->
