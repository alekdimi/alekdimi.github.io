I'm a machine learning engineer at [Google](https://about.google/), working on large language models. Before that, I did my PhD in machine learning at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](http://mingyuanzhou.github.io/), where I did research in backpropagating through discrete variables in deep learning. I also hold an M.Sc. and B.Sc. in computer science from the [University of Ljubljana](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en). 
<!-- Before starting my PhD, I worked on applying machine learning to different domains. I was a visiting researcher at Stanford University, working with [Prof. Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) on applying NLP to extract protein-protein interactions from the scientific literature. I also worked as a data scientist at [Zemanta](https://www.zemanta.com/) and [Salviol](http://www.salviol.com/) preventing fraud in native advertising and insurance claims, respectively. For more details, see my [resume](assets/pdf/Resume-Alek-Dimitriev.pdf).  In my free time, i like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9349542-alek), listen to podcasts, and think about how best to [improve the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). -->
