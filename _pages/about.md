I'm a senior machine learning engineer at Google, working on [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) finetuning and inference for teams across [Alphabet](https://abc.xyz), including a Nobel prize winner! I've been fortunate to work on a wide range of problems, ranging from multimodal capabilities augmentation, to both generative and non-generative tasks like text embedding, to automating model hyperparameters and sharding to improve training and inference efficiency.

In my free time I like to read [mostly non-fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9349542-alek?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read), and on rare occassions interview people about their work. You can watch [my interview with Scott Aaronson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK2zEyFyYXM) on LLM watermarking, or read [my interview with Richard Dawkins](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/the-future-of-religion-skepticism-with-richard-dawkins/) on the future of religion & skepticism.

Before Google, I did my PhD in machine learning at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](http://mingyuanzhou.github.io/), where [my dissertation](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/b2924809-2671-48ba-b004-5e509f50bcc0) was focused on gradient estimation for discrete variables via dependent Monte Carlo samples. I also hold an M.Sc. and B.Sc. in computer science from the [University of Ljubljana](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en).
