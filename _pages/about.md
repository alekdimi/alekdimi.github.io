I am a member of technical staff at Anthropic, working on inference.

Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at Google, working on Gemini finetuning and inference. Before that, I did my PhD in machine learning at UT Austin, advised by Prof. Mingyuan Zhou, where I did research in backpropagating through discrete variables in deep learning. In my free time I like to read [mostly non-fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9349542-alek?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read), and on rare occassions interview people about their work. You can watch [my interview with Scott Aaronson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK2zEyFyYXM) on LLM watermarking, or read [my interview with Richard Dawkins](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/the-future-of-religion-skepticism-with-richard-dawkins/) on the future of religion & skepticism.
