There is an existential threat to our species, and our species only. No, it is not A.I., nor is it climate change. It is also not one of the many ways outer space can end life in an instant, be it a gamma ray burst or an asteroid collision. Yes, these are human enders, but they are also life-enders. They are catastrophic in our collective imagination,Â  and so they receive a lot of attention so long as we get stabs of dread every time we are reminded of them.

<But there is something more specific to humans, but quieter. More certain, but more depressing. By all projections, we will have reached peak population in the next 100 years. **There have never been more people alive than this century, and there never will be**. There have never been more scientists, and there never will be.

If you can read this, consider yourself lucky; you are living in the most human-inhabited time, an earth brimming with conscious intelligent beings somehow... Right now, the universe is know...We will reach peak humanity. Contrary to ____, we *will* go gently into the night. In the arrow of time, the total sum of h...Homo sapiens is a blinding supernova, a brief explosion of intelligence...



Even Toby Ord, who wrote a [whole book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50485582-the-precipice) on existential risk, dedicates a single paragraph:

> Some people have gone so far as to suggest that the real extinction risk might now be declining population. Fertility rates in most countries outside Africa have fallen to below the replacement rate, and perhaps this will become a global trend. Even then, I don't think there is any real cause for concern. If declining population began to pose a clear and present danger (something that couldn't happen for at least two centuries), it would be a simple matter for public policy to encourage childbearing up to the replacement level. The available policy levers -- free childcare, free education, free child healthcare and tax benefits for families -- are relatively simple, non-coercive and popular.

Toby is completely wrong here. The policy levers are incredibly weak: (proof here)

On the grand time scale of the universe, which of the following will be humanity's part? Will we continually bathe the galaxy with the light of consciousness? Or is our civilization like th bright flash of a supernova that 

will we burst upon the scene like a supernova and slowly retreat back to
