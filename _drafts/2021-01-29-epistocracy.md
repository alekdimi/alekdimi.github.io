description: a driving test for voting

Oh I would love it if we can take this analogy further! That's exactly what I want for voting (I'm not being facetious).
- Not anyone can drive, only those who have a license to drive, and you have to pass a competency test. Why not make every voter pass a competency test? 
Objections:
 #1: the government will make a shit test. 

 	counterpoint: curiously we don't say this about driving tests, why believe it will be shit?
 #2: the government will systematically disenfranchise particular groups of voters. 
 	counterpoint: switch votes with drivers and it sounds ridiculous. there is no incentive
 #3: some demographics (white men) will be way more likely to pass the test as they are interested in politics to a larger degree
 	counterpoints: i dont have data but im pretty sure theres wide demographic differences between drivers and non-drivers, and no one has a problem with it.

 I am basing my whole argument on the premise that voting is an instrumental value and not an intrinstic one, i.e. democracy is the best system we have for societal welfare, but if there is another system which produces higher welfare then we should switch to that system.
