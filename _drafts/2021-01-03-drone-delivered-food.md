**Drones Unleashed**

U.S. regulators for the first time allowed commercial operators of autonomous aerial vehicles to fly out of operators’ sight.
**What’s new:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration generally requires people on the ground to keep an eye on drones, but it [authorized](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e2t/tc/VW6xh77pXRvgW1F3L9Y5jhnrLW3cF4jk4ml3c1N35KTCp5nxHkV3Zsc37CgWlHW7Q6tFR1Fjv_MW5DcHsz12vC5PW4sZ_xr2Mw6jbW26vsjQ3XlmBKW5fLLRB22lSF-W5rjJYB8cpfrdW8HzzHc25yhP3W7dMp9m8mnyMWW5dcxl73bnX51W7F5VH-7M3ZC1W6hlV8f8PGP0CW7wNQBV8wxgR-W4GdDH82JqxgVW3VCw8J7W0_n-W4hgRJs7QgsQ5W5XHLb23y5yBDV4m2c48vpQRqN8wHgmYWsBPXW2kDLN32SV4vnW90rTtd3svdRKW4cj-hF4qsFxqW3Khwd38z_rNcW7jyLxS3rVZT4W91Gp2l653Yp3W89XPTp7XflNFW66t8Dh3VvklZW4wD2w48JmdnnW1nV-Ph1CdpHXVLg0VW1zdDmpW5nrdL-4_9WWZN5BZmm4fBNdZW80yS9Q72D8_FW3_CZpB6j5DQSW5cnD3x5ZtXdZN881kbhb7fv6W2FzBYr51DChgW1RVs-s38xkMFW5Z8VTH3H1hnSW8tv8bS2CsG16VZjQjK88b44j3n1Q1) drone maker American Robotics to fly without requirement.
**How it works:** The company’s 20-pound quadcopters travel predetermined paths and automatically avoid collisions with birds, aircraft, and other obstacles.

- When they’re not in the air, the drones charge their battery in a weatherproof launch pad, which also houses computing horsepower for navigation.
- An [acoustic sensing system](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e2t/tc/VW6xh77pXRvgW1F3L9Y5jhnrLW3cF4jk4ml3c1N35KTC53p_8SV1-WJV7CgF4WW36N36S1pfvWNW3hb9BR5sBfB5W4TNY378gbQVmVc5BRC2p36DhW5N2ttZ52tjn1W6sKmVP3PDwdvW49ZpgZ1Kwn8tW3YMJLH6jRCNfW24h86H8TfmgcW8S7qX_2-Hv4tW5c-FG53WKYJTW4074cV6-RsTfW5yGh8_6HDdMGN8fbMX0K8hDWW8VdzdR8W3Sf1W14K3w35QsPpnW6xrnRR8n1NywW4nfrxX8vQcLsW2Zckmd1KGZKsW2Rd_np1lF1JgW4vnBJX2hh1JYW8tqNMP15hpWC3mQP1) recognizes the presence and direction of airborne objects. It commands the robot to descend if it detects an object flying within a two-mile perimeter.
- A human technician must run through a safety checklist and inspect drones before takeoff, but these functions can be performed remotely. Flights are limited to daylight hours, altitudes under 400 feet, and limited areas in Kansas, Massachusetts, and Nevada, according to [*The Verge*](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e2t/tc/VW6xh77pXRvgW1F3L9Y5jhnrLW3cF4jk4ml3c1N35KTBQ5nxGLV3Zsc37CgPzKW1R5gJ27sN6CjW1KBGz35WFLvZW3ygHXL8dBlFnN7F4899-z8Y_W8ZjSfx3TNtPgW5C54NH3ghZYwW2SvF8r4072zZW2TJ3kN3Rk2j3W3rDSv28qCv5HW8Wnjvk907wpwW4Rg2mG694lJnV3ctQN63dqn0W7L9ZYt16gL7SW2lT1xx3gJCZDW1-sq8n9c51ZMW8WV1q786Lc7DW146lQx96TbxfW3ccTLD8WcRbMN6lmfwmV-kNTW4_BgCp7dGjLBW9lCBFy3zRhzNW8dvYNY1YxPb-W2CMT3G585fKRVnQ9xW9km3QgW5YzQcj27Zhq3W1qZlwW5kJxjvW32DB6k2JsF2DW36tbV53j4HkJW8bXc0J3CMtTnW3lqS_58LXjZ7N1KZT9DhmhCSN79RWv_Xp-BVW3WM1vV8bmYkYW98w6n1870fl7W6P7z803FptfqW7HZH4B4gVsHm3lD71).

**Behind the news:** Companies can apply to the FAA for a waiver of the [line-of-sight rule](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e2t/tc/VW6xh77pXRvgW1F3L9Y5jhnrLW3cF4jk4ml3c1N35KTC53p_8SV1-WJV7CgXHzW42hSP78PQ9S3W1Dmlyn65RZpKW8LpPgv3GD1bZV4xHyY76psknW6BCF1m1yJhyWW3fDzv58hG4fDW5Fwz2D1cgW5vW7vhpqP6ZfM9yW7PM1zm47tt1XW2kqkp_2h0WsqW1rKQQ_1H_FHRVWr4tV2vcMmVN1RDXwD6tNb8W6_T3hF7yX48ZW3FJLsQ65V_t7W8k4WP46TMtcwW1lnKs78fd-5vW3fJ7ZK68d64CW5bVQNg3yd_RCN39pQxh5Dc5wW7zbGQP63GCdKN2RR7yxXTRpp3njc1).

- The U.S. approach to drone regulations is relatively permissive. [Most countries](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e2t/tc/VW6xh77pXRvgW1F3L9Y5jhnrLW3cF4jk4ml3c1N35KTC_3p_9LV1-WJV7CgzWwVbtbLN1drx1MW1s51_t5qYkVkW3_tcGl4SLHnYVDWlQK72Zk0sW4BgnHZ2c-9FlVQdsHk2vgCT4W2nLFb07y_vgLVlphcx1c5ngpW5f59RG6ly5QcN4knpshLgfzxW5LTxgx3WPPbcW4SxxZq3LqckfMryd3M2tC6JW8SMgzS8S-yWyW3GF-jH5l0NkDW932C084fQY-FW6tvV3v7vzTGyW4vcxwq4z4HDdVcZ8hN3Vq2G4W9kQFbW141cKYV1Zk328bYV8sW2tVdvd2sZHG3W93yJrX2WR4RCW7b0B1968WWfMVcwVTB5NKRVWW3_q8TH8z0jZTW2DzHF_69S8chW74HX8c1mv7Zn37nX1) restrict flights to an operator’s line of sight.

**Why it matters:** The ability to operate without a human in visual contact is a critical step to making drone flights easier to manage and more economical to operate.
**We’re thinking:** Andrew used to work with Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, and others on reinforcement learning to get autonomous helicopters to fly [stunts](https://info.deeplearning.ai/e2t/tc/VW6xh77pXRvgW1F3L9Y5jhnrLW3cF4jk4ml3c1N35KTC53p_8SV1-WJV7Cg-FWN4bQbYmG8CD_W3Nsl2w8Lg8wcW4YhgHc63z2wGW86NG5h7X29vjVNTyMV5ZWBqNN6GHhDwSLsDwW3D13nq1H9sdsN5GR3dKqjJ11W6GZtyR3ZhtbqW4rp-y96sjj2SN4St0Hfx8q3DW4b69Q893-ckfW1GLP4Z6FQpTgW3q5rvw37kYYbW4Qj_N724_rmNW4WpMH290Wc5kW6MFSMN3cKtKDM7fxrzP8NzFW6FxW4m4TdFSkW96f9S_3SMxJnW3DdyL46p-bPtW6cQ59p2qMsbF34sG1). He crashed quite a few copters in the process! (Safely, of course, in empty fields.) With drones now flying out of an operator’s line of sight, it’s more important than ever to subject their hardware and software to robust safety testing and verification.













Amazon has been developing its drone program since 2013. UberEats and GrubHub are also working on it. In New Zealand, drones already delivered pizza back in [2016](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/16/dominos-has-delivered-the-worlds-first-ever-pizza-by-drone-to-a-new-zealand-couple.html). In Iceland, packages have been delivered since [2018](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44466353). Unlike flying cars, we actually do have quite competent drones, except they're still mostly used to take photos of landscapes. So why are the skies not filled with swarms of zig-zagging metallic birds, akin to how people in the early 20th century imagined it? 

The first big hurdle: regulation. It is easy to understand why there will always be excess regulation: you'll only be blamed if you are not strict enough, so you cover your ass until the difference between legs and butt has but disappeared. Even just for pilots, the FAA mandates that for safety purposes:

* The drone needs to be operated by a human pilot
* Only one drone per pilot
* The pilot must have *line of sight at all times*

This is ludicrous. Drones will never become viable if tethered to a meat machine controller. We have to trust machine learning enough to control them. I'm worried drones will never take off (pun intended), or do so much later than possible because of stringent regulation. If Wilbur et al. had to worry about the noise pollution, or encroaching on the empty space overhead, would we have had flight in 1903 at all? Would it have developed as quickly as it did?

Second, I'm worried about opposition from NIMBYs (Not In My Back Yard). It's already happening with wind turbines. People like clean green energy, they just don't want it near them, because of [wind turbine syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_syndrome), the totally real effect of air moving near you causing... cancer and death. Sure, drones are great, but I don't want them flying over *my* property, just everyone else's. There could, however, be legitimate issues; I'm not sure how detrimental bad weather might be for a drone, and noise could be an actual problem. People prefer the low rumble of cars to the high pitched buzz of a drone. But if people decades ago could know how noisy streets are, they would have opposed them much more because they couldn't even imagine all the benefits of a strong transportation infrastructure. So yes, drones might be noisy for now, but it might be worth it.

Lastly, we need to be wary of [status quo bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias), which pervades debates about new technologies. It's hard to be excited for a future that hasn't materialized yet, but just spending a few minutes visualizing a sky full of droning drones should be exciting. Think of all of the packages that could be delivered [within 30 minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/amazon-prime-now-drone-delivery-fleet-gets-faa-approval.html) instead of days, or [vaccines to remote locations](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/merck-teams-up-volansi-to-test-drones-for-vaccine-delivery-north-carolina), and so much more cheaply than tasking a whole human to do it for you. Now think of all the transactions not happening right now, of goods and materials not being delivered, and people and businesses having to wait so much longer. Let's make that exciting first future happen.
