One of the most underrated medical improvements in the last forty years is the fact that the overall cancer rate went from a 1 in 2 chance of dying within 5 years, to a 1 in 3 chance. And for some types, specifically, like prostate cancer, the improvement is astonishing, from a 1 in 3 chance to 1 in 70! As always, [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer#cancer-survival-rates) makes it clear:

There are several reasons why this is not as widely known as it should be. First, the chance that you get cancer has increased, but that's actually a consequence of a good thing, as Joseph Heath puts it in [Economics Without Illusions](https://smile.amazon.com/Economics-Without-Illusions-Debunking-Capitalism/dp/0307590577/ref=sr_1_1):

> Whenever we remove one cause of death (plague, polio, tuberculosis, cholera) the rates of everything else go up... this increase in cancer has coincided with dramatic improvements in average life expectancy. Live long enough, and you're guaranteed to get cancer... The overall trend in cancer rates has been up because more people are making it to an age where they are likely to develop it -- because they are not dying of other things that used to kill significant percentages of the population.

The world is definitely getting older; the median age in 1970 was 21.5, whereas today it's 30 years. Cancer is one of the last few hurdles to our eventual immortality, and sometimes we forget we got rid of almost everything else that used to plague us. 

Another reason why it's not widely known is easy to discern if you have ever considered what are the characteristics of a sensational story. News stories are, unfortunately: mostly negative, about current/recent events, and shocking/unexpected. On the other hand, this amazing fact is about a positive decades-long battle with the emperor of all maladies. It's an inspiring long-term trend like the decline of violence, which has a similar PR problem: most people still think crime is going up (thanks to the media). It also doesn't help that cancer kills slowly and quietly, unlike the sporadic acts of terrorism that grip our attention (even though they kill a thousand times fewer people than than cancer each year).

Now for the reasons why we're saving so many more lives from cancer: a combination of early detection, better treatment methods, and the fact that smoking is going down across the world. It's unfortunate that there are still many lives needlessly lost from smoking, but at least the trajectory is in the right direction. However, there's also a rise in obesity, which contributes to increase in the rates of some specific cancers. Hopefully we can reverse this.

Last year, about 10 million people died from cancer. Assuming very crudely that there were 30 million potential deaths (our current five year death rate is 1 in 3), if we hadn't made all this progress it might have been around 15 million deaths. Even conservatively, we can say that millions of lives have been saved due to these improvements. I don't know about you, but that's pretty inspiring to me.
