It took us *two days* to develop a candidate vaccine. So what the hell happened? How did we end up in December 2020 just now rolling out the distribution of this vaccine? Let's look at [Moderna's timeline](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19) again:

1. [The COVID-19 genome was sequenced and public on January 11](https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319/28)
2. [The form of the Moderna mRNA vaccine was finalized by January 13](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11)
3. [The first vaccine batch was manufactured by February 07](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-progress-prophylactic-vaccines-modality-cmv)
4. [We started vaccinating by March 16](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins) \| [Death toll: <10,000](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-covid-deaths-region)

To roll out a vaccine, we need to know three things: is it safe, is it effective, and is it better than the alternatives? Since we have no cure or treatment, the last question is clear, but what about the other two? By May 18th we knew it was [probably safe and effective](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/18/early-data-show-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-generates-immune-response): the 25 μg and 100 μg doses were safe and produced antibodies at the level seen in patients who recovered from the infections. By this time COVID-19 had already killed at least [100,000 people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html) just in the US and 300,000+ worldwide. Yet, collectively as a society, we thought, why not take it slow? Why not do yet another trial, with more people, and see what happens? So we did, and [by July 27th](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/14/moderna-covid19-vaccine-first-data-show-spurs-immune-response/) (death toll: 650,000+) we were even more certain. But after two whole months, we just dithered how the level of antibodies is encouraging and more research is needed. At this point, there were 200,000 U.S. deaths. 

Finally, the *coup de grâce*, the Phase III trial begins. We will see if people who are vaccinated get COVID, compared to a placebo group of the same size. So we'll give the participants the virus and see if this vaccine works, right? Just kidding! We'll just let them go back to society, and monitor them for months until some number of people get randomly infected.  Then, since most of them got the placebo, we [infer that the vaccine is effective](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy). Doesn't this mean the rest of the 30,000 people were useless? The whole approach is actually worse than useless, because of the huge opportunity cost it brought. We waited *four months*. In those excruciatingly slow four months, 500,000 more people died, while we patiently twiddled our thumbs waiting for 100 "natural" infections to occur. There might have been other, less clear speedups, but this has to be one of the easiest. Letting these people die is not the same as killing them, but not making a decision and waiting is a decision, a course of action, that resulted in these deaths. 

Why the hell did we wait four months?  Why didn't we just pick 100 or even 1000 people to get deliberately infected to see how good the vaccine is? Lack of volunteers is surely not an issue. By the end of September, [400,000 Americans](https://apnews.com/article/how-to-volunteer-covid-19-vaccine-study-1e47aff85bac726396672688320a397d) had volunteered. Was it unethical to infect a few people to save a million? Somehow it fine to give a placebo shot to half of them and let them catch the virus on their own, but not to infect people who have volunteered to get infected? Lest you think this is by any means crazy, the UK is planning to infect volunteers in... [January 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/uk-covid-19-vaccine-trial-set-to-infect-healthy-volunteers-with-virus). I'm not sure what's the point at his point, but it at least means that it must not be that unethical.

There are so many other things we could criticize. Why did enrollment begin in July but end in [October](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-completes-enrollment-phase-3-cove-study-mrna-vaccine)? I don't know why it took so long to recruit participants, surely they could have been selected during the Phase II trials? There are probably several reasons for general slowness, but at least one is that enrollment was temporarily slowed down in September due to concerns over [minority representation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/moderna-slows-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-t-to-ensure-minority-representation-ceo-says.html) in the cohort, with Moderna's CEO saying: "*I would rather we have higher diverse participants and take one extra week... Diversity matters more to us than speed.*" In one week in December, when the vaccine rollout started, 100,000 people died from COVID-19. How was this decision made and expressed with such certainty? Have we traded a slight increase in diversity, such as going from 7% to 10% Black representation, for 100,000 deaths?

Every important decision is some kind of a trade-off. Do we ensure maximum safety of the participants or do we take a risk, but save many more with an earlier vaccine? We opted for too much safety for a small number of people, leaving a thousand times more people to die. Neglecting the downsides of taking it slow was probably our biggest mistake. In 2020, 333,000 people in the U.S. died, and 1.75 million worldwide (likely a significant underestimate).

In the time between writing a draft and publishing this, Scott Aaronson [expressed](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5224) a similar exasperation:

> I think almost everyone on earth could have, and should have, already been vaccinated by now. I think a faster, “WWII-style” approach would’ve saved millions of lives, prevented economic destruction, and carried negligible risks compared to its benefits. I think this will be clear to future generations, who’ll write PhD theses exploring how it was possible that we invented multiple effective covid vaccines in mere days or weeks, but then simply sat on those vaccines for a year, ticking off boxes called “Phase I,” “Phase II,” etc. while civilization hung in the balance.

The rest of his post is more nuanced and suffused with gratefulness for the still amazing accomplishment of rolling out a vaccine in less than year, beating the previous record of 4 years. Mine is a sharper and more critical take, in the hope that some disparagement might shake us from our meek acceptance that we had to dutifully go through the regular motions. It's as if we forgot that desperate times call for more drastic measures. 

Our failure is, to an extent, understandable, since we've never had such a time sensitive crisis when we could actually do something about it. Unlike the 1918 flu, or the plagues of past, for the first time in history, humanity was finally powerful enough to launch a swift counterattack. But we failed. We worked within the system, using inside-the-box thinking. We just sped up the same protocols designed for a years long evaluation of a prospective treatment. They were designed when the opportunity cost of taking it slow was low, not when hospitals are overflowing and the world is shutting down. I hope we learn our lesson, and next time act swiftly, decisively, and with more caring for the thousands of lives lost because we were just being careful.
