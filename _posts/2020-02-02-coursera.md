There is a lot of free and useful information online, especially in the form of MOOCs (massive open online courses), but sometimes the sheer amount can feel overwhelming. This is a small biased sample of the knowledge that [Coursera](coursera.org) and [edX](edx.org) offered between 2012 and 2015, knowledge that greatly expanded by the end of the decade. All of them are courses I have taken from beginning to end and earned a certificate of accomplishment, so my opinion is based on the whole course, not just the first few videos. To keep it simple, I have ordered all the courses from most "worth it" to least, but they are separated into two lists, as a lot of the them were specific to my major, computer science. There is no line within each list separating the good from the bad, so you can decided where to draw the line depending on how much more you weigh the following aspects:
* The opportunity cost to the dozens of hours required for a course that can be spent working or studying. If that cost is high to you, you should be more picky. 
* The human capital benefit. If you are young, the knowledge can compound for longer and offer great returns on time, so you might want to take more courses.

First, the list of general courses. I highly recommend everyone take the first ten courses as their knowledge has stayed with me even five years after. 
Conversely, I anti-recommend taking any course in the lower half of either list. Although some of the lower-ranked courses are there because I can only vaguely recall them, that itself is an indicator that they haven't stood the test of time.

| [Dino 101: Dinosaur Paleobiology](/assets/certificates/dinosaur-paleobiology-97.pdf) | The age of the dinosaurs is reality manifestly more fantastical than fantasy. |
| [Unpredictable? Randomness, Chance and Free Will](/assets/certificates/randomness-chance-86.pdf) | Free will is an illusion. |
| [Know Thyself](/assets/certificates/know-thyself-85.pdf) | The self is an illusion. |

| [From the Big Bang to Dark Energy](/assets/certificates/big-bang-to-dark-energy-96.pdf) | A contemporary account of cosmology, but better to take the one above. |
| [Confronting The Big Questions: Highlights of Modern Astronomy](/assets/certificates/highlights-of-modern-astronomy-96.pdf) | Same as above. |
| [Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life](/assets/certificates/astrobiology-99.pdf) | Since we haven't found other life, not a good use of your time. |
| [AstroTech: The Science and Technology behind Astronomical Discovery](/assets/certificates/astro-tech-100.pdf) | Telescopes might be immensely useful, but not that important to learn about. |
| [The Language of Hollywood: Storytelling, Sound, and Color](/assets/certificates/language-of-hollywood-95.pdf) | Somewhat useful for complete laymen to film-making. |
| [Nutrition, Health, and Lifestyle: Issues and Insights](/assets/certificates/nutrition-health-99.pdf) | Not as good as the above nutrition course. |
| [Introduction to Philosophy](/assets/certificates/intro-philosophy-90.pdf) | Better to just listen to the podcast *Philosophize This!*.
| [The Ancient Greeks](/assets/certificates/ancient-greeks-97.pdf) | Not worth the time. |
| [Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets](/assets/certificates/archaeology-94.pdf) | Archaelogy somehow became less interesting than before taking it. |
| [The Science of Gastronomy](/assets/certificates/science-of-gastronomy-100.pdf) | Unfortunately, it had some myths like different tongue areas having different taste buds. | 
| [How Things Work](/assets/certificates/how-things-work-78.pdf) | Fun, but not very useful physics experiments. |
| [Fundamentals of Music Theory](/assets/certificates/fundamentals-of-music-theory-80.pdf) | Useful only for aspiring composers. |
| [Introduction to Digital Sound Design](/assets/certificates/intro-digital-sound-design-90.pdf) | Applicable only for people who compose with software. |
| [Introduction to Guitar](/assets/certificates/intro-guitar-94.pdf) | A MOOC is no replacement for an in-person guitar instructor. |

The recommmendations below are for computer science majors only. I highly recommend you take the first five courses.

| Course | Blurb |
